/*
 EasyDriver.h - Arduino Library for EasyDriver 3.0 stepper driver board from Sparkfun.com
 
 Based on:
 Stepper.h - - Stepper library for Wiring/Arduino - Version 0.4
 Original library     (0.1) by Tom Igoe.
 Two-wire modifications   (0.2) by Sebastian Gassner
 Combination version   (0.3) by Tom Igoe and David Mellis
 Bug fix for four-wire   (0.4) by Tom Igoe, bug fix from Noah Shibley


     I wanted This library to be a simple drop-in replacement for the standard stepper lib.
     just change some defines and go!!
